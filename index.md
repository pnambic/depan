## Welcome to DepAn

DepAn is a direct manipulation tool for visualization, analysis, and refactoring of dependencies in large applications.

## DepAn Releases

Watch this space for information about pre-packaged releases.

If your development environment supports Maven, you should be able to build an executable for Windows in a few minutes. Other platforms are likely to work, but I have no reports to confirm this.

## DepAn Features

* Direct manipulation of heterogeneous dependency information in an Eclipse RCP environment.
* Analysis and visualization of very large applications.
* For Java, dependency discovery at the class member level.
* Import of FileSystems? as source of dependency information.
* Collapse child dependency into parent entities to reveal class level interactions.
* Selection of nodes by type, edge-count, and paths.
